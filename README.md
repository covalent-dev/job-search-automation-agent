# Job Bot

Automated job application system using Playwright browser automation.

## Status: v0.0 (Testing Phase)

Currently testing LinkedIn automation fundamentals before building the full application bot.

## Roadmap

- ✅ **v0.0** (Week 1, Jan 2026): Playwright testing foundation
  - Session management (login persistence)
  - Locator strategy testing (5 methods compared)
  - Best practices documented
  
-  **v0.1** (Week 4): Basic job scraping
  - Scrape 50+ jobs from Indeed
  - Extract: title, company, location, description
  - Save to CSV/database
  
-  **v0.2** (Week 5): Easy Apply automation
  - Auto-fill application forms
  - Resume upload
  - Track applications
  
-  **v1.0** (Week 6): Multi-platform + AI filtering
  - LinkedIn + Indeed + Greenhouse
  - AI filters jobs by fit score
  - Daily application reports

## Current Progress (v0.0)

### What's Been Tested

**Session Management:**
- Login cookies saved to JSON
- Persistent sessions across runs
- No re-login required

**Locator Strategies:**
Tested 5 different methods for finding "Easy Apply" button:
1. ✅ `get_by_role` - Most reliable (1 exact match)
2. ✅ `get_by_text` - Good fallback (4 matches)
3. ✅ CSS selectors - Works (3 matches)
4. ✅ XPath - Functional but fragile
5. ❌ Class names - Too brittle (LinkedIn changes frequently)

**Key Findings:**
- `get_by_role` is most stable for production use
- `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` best for React apps
- Session management prevents rate limiting

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Playwright** - Browser automation
- **Ollama + DeepSeek** (future) - AI job filtering
