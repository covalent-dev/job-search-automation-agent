      "description_full": "About the job\n\nWe believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.\n\nWe aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being.\n\nWe believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.\n\nRula is a remote-first company. We currently hire in most U.S. states, with the exception of Hawaii.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nAt Rula, this role owns the AI foundation that determines how, and how well, AI shows up across mental healthcare. The focus isn\u2019t on prototypes or isolated features, but on building durable, production-grade generative AI systems that directly power patient engagement, provider workflows, and clinical operations at scale.\n\nYou\u2019ll operate where architecture, applied research, and real-world constraints meet. The work includes designing core AI platforms, setting technical standards for safety, reliability, and performance, and making principald decisions about how advanced AI is introduced into a regulated, high-stakes care environment. The goal is simple but hard: make AI genuinely useful in clinical contexts, without compromising trust or outcomes.\n\nThis is a deeply hands-on role with real technical ownership. You\u2019ll define system architecture, unblock complex engineering problems, and act as a technical multiplier for other engineers working across product surfaces. Success here means creating foundations that others can build on confidently and that hold up under scale, scrutiny, and real patient impact.\n\nThe opportunity is less about chasing the frontier for its own sake and more about shaping how AI responsibly becomes part of everyday mental healthcare, setting direction not just for what we build next, but for how AI evolves inside the care ecosystem over time.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\n\n10+ years of software engineering, including 7+ years of experience with Public Cloud (AWS, GCP, etc.), 5+ years designing and scaling distributed systems.\n5+ years of deep experience in Python and at least one backend language (preferably JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, or Go)\n2+ years of proven track record building AI-powered products at scale, including hands-on experience with foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, etc.).\n2+ years of strong experience in LLM integration patterns (RAG, function calling, agents, memory routing, etc.), or AI orchestration frameworks (eg. LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, Haystack), or vector databases (eg. Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, Milvus).\n3+ years in working with MLOps, data pipelines, evaluation, and observability systems for continuous model improvement.\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\nExperience architecting secure and compliant AI solutions in regulated environments (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).\nFamiliarity with human-in-the-loop systems and clinical decision support frameworks.\nExperience designing evaluation pipelines for human alignment, factual accuracy, or model interpretability.\nContributions to open-source AI frameworks or applied research in NLP, healthcare AI, or GenAI safety.\nExperience contributing to early-stage team growth (0 \u2192 1)\nExperience leading or mentoring engineering teams in AI, ML platform, or applied research domains.\n\n\nWe're serious about your well-being! As part of our team, full-time employees receive:\n\n\n100% remote work environment: Working hours to support a healthy work-life balance, ensuring you can meet both professional and personal commitments (must be based in United States, currently not hiring in Hawaii)\nAttractive pay and benefits: Full transparency of pay ranges regardless of where you live in the United States\nComprehensive health benefits: Medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and FSA/HSA\n401(k) plan access: Start saving for your future\nGenerous time-off policies: Including 2 company-wide shutdown weeks each year for self-care (for most employees)\nPaid parental leave: Available for all parents, including birthing, non-birthing, adopting, and fostering\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP): Support for your mental and physical health\nNew hire home office stipend: Set up your workspace for success\nQuarterly department stipend: Fund team-building activities or in-person gatherings\nWellness events and lunch & learns: Explore a variety of engaging topics\nCommunity and employee resource groups: Participate in groups that celebrate employee identity and lived experiences, fostering a sense of community and belonging for all\n\n\nOur team\n\nWe believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are fundamental to our mission of making mental healthcare work for everyone. We are dedicated to having a culture of inclusion that will support our employees in feeling safe, seen, heard, and valued.",
