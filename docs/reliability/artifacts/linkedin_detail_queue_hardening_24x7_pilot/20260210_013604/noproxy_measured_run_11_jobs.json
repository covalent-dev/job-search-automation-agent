      "description_full": "About the job\n\nAI Scout - Commission-Based Partnership\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions | Remote | Flexible | 1099 Contractor\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\n\n\n\nVisit: https://kerzieconsulting.com/ai-scout-opportunity\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"Apply Now\" button and fill out the application form to apply.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions is building a network of AI Scouts - driven individuals who identify Small businesses struggling with customer communication and connect them with Unison, our AI-powered solution that handles phone calls, texts, website chat/voice, and social media channels from a single knowledge base.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a traditional sales job. You are a scout - someone who spots opportunity before others do. You find the HVAC company whose calls go to voicemail after 5pm. The dental office drowning in appointment requests. The property manager who cannot keep up with tenant inquiries. You get the contract signed; we handle the rest.\n\n\n\n\nHow you find businesses is up to you. Tap your existing network, join a business networking group, cold call, knock on doors, run ads, leverage social media, attend local events - whatever works. We care about results, not methods.\n\n\n\n\nSuccess in this role looks like: Building a portfolio of 15+ clients generating $2,900+/month in recurring commission, while helping small businesses deliver consistent customer experiences around the clock. There is no ceiling on this. You can do the math to see what your exit from the 9-5 treadmill looks like if that is your goal. This can also be a lucrative side hustle. This is different for every scout. The opportunity is there if you want it. \n\n\n\n\nHow this fits into Kerzie AI: Scouts are our frontline growth engine. While our team focuses on building and delivering Unison, you are out in the world finding the businesses who need it most. As we scale toward 300 clients, scouts who get in early will build substantial recurring income streams.\n\n\n\n\nCOMMISSION STRUCTURE\n\n\n\n\nHere is where this opportunity is different from anything you will find in corporate America.\n\n\n\n\nMost sales roles pay you once and move on. Maybe you get a small residual for a quarter or two. Then it is back to zero, chasing the next deal just to stay employed.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a monthly recurring commission structure - and it is virtually unheard of at these rates:\n\n\n\n\n1-2 contracts: 20%\n\n3-9 contracts: 35%\n\n10+ contracts: 50%\n\n\n\n\nExample earnings at $500/month per client:\n\n- 5 clients = $725/month recurring\n\n- 10 clients = $1,675/month recurring\n\n- 20 clients = $4,175/month recurring\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: THIS IS A 1099 CONTRACTOR POSITION\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a W-2 employee role. You are an independent contractor. There is no base salary, no hourly wage, and no guaranteed income. Your earnings are 100% commission-based, determined entirely by the contracts you bring in.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, the upside is real: every contract you sign generates monthly recurring income for as long as that customer continues paying for Unison. You are not building someone else's book of business - you are building your own.\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\n\n- Get Unison contracts signed\n\n\n\n\n- Identify small and mid-sized businesses that struggle with customer communication (missed calls, slow response times, lost leads, inconsistent messaging across channels)\n\n\n\n\n- Acquire leads through any method you choose - networking groups, cold outreach, social media, local events, referrals, or creative approaches we have not thought of\n\n\n\n\n- Understand businesses current communication challenges\n\n\n\n\n- Qualify leads by assessing fit for Unison\n\n\n\n\n- Introduce qualified prospects to the Kerzie AI team for onboarding\n\n\n\n\n- Maintain relationships with referred clients to identify additional opportunities and gather feedback\n\n\n\n\n- Track your pipeline and referrals using provided tools and systems\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE PROVIDE\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need to be an AI expert. You do not need to know how to build automations. We will train you on everything you need to know - how to talk to business owners about Unison, how to explain automation in simple terms, and how to identify the pain points that make a business a great fit. You show up ready to learn and hustle; we will make sure you are prepared to get contracts signed.\n\n\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nRequired:\n\n\n\n\n- Strong interpersonal and communication skills - you are comfortable starting conversations with business owners\n\n\n\n\n-Experienced in B2B sales or consulting\n\n\n\n\n- Self-motivated with the ability to work independently without daily supervision\n\n\n\n\n- Coachable - willing to learn how we talk about AI and automation so you can confidently represent Unison\n\n\n\n\n- Resourcefulness in finding and reaching potential clients through whatever channels work for you\n\n\n\n\n- Reliable internet access and smartphone\n\n\n\n\nPreferred:\n\n\n\n\n- Familiarity with local business communities (Existing network, Chamber of Commerce, BNI, industry associations, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n- Understanding of how small businesses operate - their challenges, constraints, and priorities\n\n\n\n\nNot Required:\n\n\n\n\n- Technical background or coding experience\n\n\n\n\n- AI expertise or experience building automations - we teach you everything you need to know\n\n\n\n\n- Full-time availability - You choose how much time you would like to invest in this opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT KERZIE AI SOLUTIONS\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions helps small businesses deliver consistent, high-quality customer communication across every channel - 24/7. Our flagship product, Unison, combines telecom expertise with applied AI to handle phone calls, website chat/voice, SMS, and social media channel inquiries from a unified knowledge base.\n\n\n\n\nWe believe every business deserves the customer communication infrastructure of a Fortune 500 company. Unison makes that possible at $500/month with no hidden fees or per-message charges.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Kerzie AI and Unison: https://kerzie.ai\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\n\n\n\nVisit: https://kerzieconsulting.com/ai-scout-opportunity\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"Apply Now\" button and fill out the application form to apply.",
