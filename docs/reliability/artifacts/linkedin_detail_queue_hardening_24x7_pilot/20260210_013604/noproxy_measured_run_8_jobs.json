      "description_full": "About the job\n\nWe are seeking motivated individuals who are curious about artificial intelligence and excited to learn how advanced AI models are built, evaluated, and improved. This project is designed for people who are early in their academic journey, exploring potential specialties, or simply eager to gain hands-on exposure to real-world AI development projects. No prior experience is required\u2014what matters most is your willingness to learn, ask questions, and engage thoughtfully with new concepts.\n\nIn this project, you will interact directly with AI systems, review model outputs, follow clear task guidelines, and contribute to the creation of high-quality training data. You may work on activities such as evaluating responses, identifying inconsistencies, providing feedback, or helping structure information so that models learn more effectively. All tasks are well-defined, and you will receive guidance and examples to help you succeed as you build confidence over time.\n\nYou should be comfortable working independently, paying close attention to detail, and communicating clearly about what you observe. A thoughtful, reflective approach\u2014explaining your reasoning and noting uncertainties\u2014is highly valued, as it helps improve both the models and the training process. This project is well-suited for individuals who enjoy problem-solving, learning through practice, and contributing to innovative technology in a structured environment.\n\nThis project offers a unique opportunity to gain practical exposure to AI development without needing a technical background. You\u2019ll develop transferable skills in critical thinking, evaluation, and structured communication while contributing to systems that are shaping the future of technology across many industries.\n\nIf you\u2019re excited to learn, open to feedback, and interested in being part of the process that helps AI systems improve and evolve, this project provides a supportive entry point into the world of AI training and development.\n\nWe offer a pay range of $6-to-\u202f$65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you\u2019ll supply a secure computer and high\u2011speed internet; company\u2011sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.\n\nProject Title: Entry-Level AI Generalist (No Experience Required)\n\nContract Type: Freelance / Contract\n\nWorkplace type: Remote",
