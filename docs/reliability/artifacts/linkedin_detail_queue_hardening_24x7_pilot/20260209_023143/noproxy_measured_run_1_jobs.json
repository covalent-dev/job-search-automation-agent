      "description_full": "About the job\n\nHeadway\u2019s mission is a big one \u2013 to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We\u2019ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.\n\n1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don\u2019t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to accept insurance and scale their practice.\n\nHeadway was founded in 2019. Since then, we\u2019ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 60,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software and have served over 1 million patients.

Your systems-thinking mindset will empower our platform to move faster, scale smarter, and deliver accuracy at scale.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first 90 days, you will conquer the following:\n\n30-Day Deliverables:\n\nAudit all current production prompts and identify at least 3 key inconsistency risks across our core flows (accuracy, structure, or latency).\nCreate and document a standardized JSON schema format for all structured outputs and enforce it across at least 2 primary use cases.\nBuild a \"Golden Dataset\" of 100+ validated prompt/input-output examples to serve as a foundation for regression testing.\n\n\n\n\n60-Day Deliverables:\n\nLaunch automated regression testing for at least 3 production prompts, with a defined performance scoring system (accuracy, structure adherence, token cost).\nBenchmark at least 2 LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5) for latency, cost, and output consistency on key use cases; present findings and recommendation.\nCollaborate with engineering to integrate prompt versioning into Git or a prompt ops platform; document and train team on rollback protocol.\n\n\n\n\n90-Day Deliverables:\n\nDesign and deploy a full prompt evaluation suite (Eval) that triggers on prompt updates, validating against golden datasets.\nOptimize at least 2 prompts for lower token usage while maintaining \u226595% accuracy on critical structured outputs.\nPublish a 90-day prompt performance report tracking model behavior, format consistency, and improvement over time.\n\n\n\n\nSoft Skills\n\nYou thrive in ambiguity, love systems thinking, and obsess over repeatability. Your communication is crisp and direct\u2014because clarity builds trust across engineering and product teams. You\u2019re the person who calls out vague requirements and replaces them with testable criteria. You have a scientific mindset, a relentless curiosity, and a deep intolerance for flakiness in AI behavior. You play well with builders but know how to lead when it\u2019s time to ship.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nYou bring hands-on experience with OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source LLMs via API\u2014not just chat interfaces. You\u2019ve deployed prompt chains that use advanced techniques like CoT, Few-Shot, and ToT prompting to solve complex problems. You know how to enforce strict JSON/XML structures in responses, and how to test them for integrity. You\u2019re fluent in Python and capable of building eval harnesses using tools like LangChain, DSPy, or custom logic. You can benchmark models, dial in temperature, and debug prompt behaviors under load.\n\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nYou\u2019ve done real-world prompt engineering\u2014not just demos. You think in systems, not scripts. You\u2019ve created evaluation frameworks to score prompt performance, enforced structure in LLM outputs, and understand how to trade off between model cost, latency, and accuracy. If you can\u2019t explain how you use regression testing for prompts or how to enforce a JSON schema 100% of the time, this isn\u2019t the role for you. We\u2019re not looking for content writers\u2014we\u2019re hiring engineers who treat prompts as critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nIntertru.ai is a method-driven interviewing accuracy platform that uses AI and the HireOS\u00ae methodology to ensure that your company hires the strongest people, every time. We released our MVP in November and have already secured paying customers.
