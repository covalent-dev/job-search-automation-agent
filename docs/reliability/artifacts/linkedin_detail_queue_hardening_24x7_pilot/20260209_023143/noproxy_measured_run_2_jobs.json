      "description_full": "About the job\n\nPlease do NOT apply to this role through LinkedIn! ... US Only\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s face it, nobody cares about a puffed-up job description telling you how \u201ccutting edge\u201d the company is.\n\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s make this about you.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about you being a builder... and currently not building anything that actually works under pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s about you craving deeper technical challenges, but you\u2019re too busy duct-taping brittle prompts to chase that dream.\n\nIt\u2019s about you knowing there's a better way\u2014one rooted in consistency, metrics, and clarity\u2014but your current team thinks \u201ctalking nicely to the model\u201d is enough.\n\nIt\u2019s about you wanting ownership over cognitive systems that behave as predictably as real code.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026And it\u2019s about you tackling the hard problems\u2014like output reliability, schema enforcement, and evaluation pipelines\u2014that actually move AI from magic to product.\n\n\n\n\nYour Problems Solved!\n\nThis is not a \"creative writing\" gig. You\u2019ll engineer deterministic behavior inside non-deterministic systems. Your mission is to architect prompts that yield consistent, structured outputs (primarily JSON), integrate directly into Intertru.ai\u2019s API-driven stack, and hold up under real-world usage\u2014every time.\n\n\n\n\nBy designing golden datasets, regression test suites, and evaluation metrics, your work will define what \"reliable AI\" means. You\u2019ll analyze performance across models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and open-source alternatives to select the best engine for each job. Your systems-thinking mindset will empower our platform to move faster, scale smarter, and deliver accuracy at scale.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first 90 days, you will conquer the following:\n\n30-Day Deliverables:\n\nAudit all current production prompts and identify at least 3 key inconsistency risks across our core flows (accuracy, structure, or latency).\nCreate and document a standardized JSON schema format for all structured outputs and enforce it across at least 2 primary use cases.\nBuild a \"Golden Dataset\" of 100+ validated prompt/input-output examples to serve as a foundation for regression testing.\n\n\n\n\n60-Day Deliverables:\n\nLaunch automated regression testing for at least 3 production prompts, with a defined performance scoring system (accuracy, structure adherence, token cost).\nBenchmark at least 2 LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5) for latency, cost, and output consistency on key use cases; present findings and recommendation.\nCollaborate with engineering to integrate prompt versioning into Git or a prompt ops platform; document and train team on rollback protocol.\n\n\n\n\n90-Day Deliverables:\n\nDesign and deploy a full prompt evaluation suite (Eval) that triggers on prompt updates, validating against golden datasets.\nOptimize at least 2 prompts for lower token usage while maintaining \u226595% accuracy on critical structured outputs.\nPublish a 90-day prompt performance report tracking model behavior, format consistency, and improvement over time.\n\n\n\n\nSoft Skills\n\nYou thrive in ambiguity, love systems thinking, and obsess over repeatability. Your communication is crisp and direct\u2014because clarity builds trust across engineering and product teams. You\u2019re the person who calls out vague requirements and replaces them with testable criteria. You have a scientific mindset, a relentless curiosity, and a deep intolerance for flakiness in AI behavior. You play well with builders but know how to lead when it\u2019s time to ship.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nYou bring hands-on experience with OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source LLMs via API\u2014not just chat interfaces. You\u2019ve deployed prompt chains that use advanced techniques like CoT, Few-Shot, and ToT prompting to solve complex problems. You know how to enforce strict JSON/XML structures in responses, and how to test them for integrity. You\u2019re fluent in Python and capable of building eval harnesses using tools like LangChain, DSPy, or custom logic. You can benchmark models, dial in temperature, and debug prompt behaviors under load.\n\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nYou\u2019ve done real-world prompt engineering\u2014not just demos. You think in systems, not scripts. You\u2019ve created evaluation frameworks to score prompt performance, enforced structure in LLM outputs, and understand how to trade off between model cost, latency, and accuracy. If you can\u2019t explain how you use regression testing for prompts or how to enforce a JSON schema 100% of the time, this isn\u2019t the role for you. We\u2019re not looking for content writers\u2014we\u2019re hiring engineers who treat prompts as critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nIntertru.ai is a method-driven interviewing accuracy platform that uses AI and the HireOS\u00ae methodology to ensure that your company hires the strongest people, every time. We released our MVP in November and have already secured paying customers. We are bootstrapped, pre-funded, and solving massive challenges\u2014especially around customer success delivery and execution excellence. \n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re managing, but we\u2019re also pushing limits every day.\n\nWhat really makes us a place where you\u2019ll thrive? Our Core Values. We live by them. We hire by them. We build by them. https://www.intertru.ai\n\n\n\n\nOur core values guide our commitment to excellence:\n\nYou First\n\nWe prioritize and empower your growth. We care deeply about you and your business. Our actions demonstrate genuine empathy, understanding, and solutions that deliver measurable value to you. Also, we say please, thank you, and hold the door open for others.\n\nDig Deeper\n\nWe listen to understand, not to respond and it is in our nature to ask the difficult questions that enable us to attack the root of the issue. We consistently hone our expertise using targeted data. Making sure our solutions are proven in the real world with concrete results.\n\nCommit Action\n\nWe set measurable goals, hold each other accountable, and take corrective action.

We operate from win-win and walk from win-lose situations.\n\nRe-Evolutionary\n\nWe are people who defy the shackles of conventional constraints. We reject \u201cbest practices\u201d \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d, or the \u201cstatus quo\u201d perspectives that produce mediocre results. With a relentless spirit of rebellion, we celebrate failure and challenge one another to break boundaries and rewrite the rules of what real success means.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s your Call To Action!\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you have grit\u2014and we should meet. While a resume is important, we want to get to know you as a person.\n\n\n\n\nPlease email your resume to rick@intertru.ai and answer these three questions:\n\nWhat motivated you to respond to this role?\nWhat do you feel you are capable of achieving?\nHow can we best reach you for a conversation this week?\n\n\n\n\nWe only respond to people who invest the time in providing well-thought-out (non-AI) responses!",

Build tools that support knowledge reuse, automated content generation, resume tagging, compliance matrix generation, and competitor analysis. Collaborate closely with growth leaders to align agentic capabilities with pipeline objectives , proposal timelines, and opportunity strategy. Quantify improvements in velocity, win rates, and cost-efficiency tied to AI enablement across the growth engine.\n\n Address Enterprise Architecture Challenges and Improve Content Readiness \n\nEngage deeply with DDC\u2019s broader enterprise architecture environment including business process design, data architecture, application integration, and infrastructure architecture. Navigate technical debt and fragmentation, especially in systems such as SharePoint where document libraries are siloed and business processes are inconsistently applied. Implement minimum viable products (MVPs) that include workaround strategies when necessary but include forward-looking requirements and recommendations for department heads and functional leads to refactor and improve enterprise content exposure. Drive alignment between agent expectations and content quality, ensuring that both human collaborators and AI agents can efficiently access, interpret, and act upon enterprise knowledge.\n\n Develop Agentic Integrations Across Core DDC Systems \n\nDesign and implement model-to-application interactions that integrate Stack AI agents with core enterprise platforms including SharePoint, Outlook, Teams, ServiceNow, and Workday. Use the Stack AI platform\u2019s supported integrations to enable agents to read and write data, automate ticket creation, retrieve HR policies, query calendars, and interact with collaborative content. Establish repeatable connection patterns, access control rules, data normalization strategies, and fallback handling to ensure secure, efficient tool usage across critical enterprise systems.\n\n Expand and Operationalize DDC\u2019s Intelligence Ecosystem \n\nContinuously broaden the scope and fidelity of DDC\u2019s AI-accessible knowledge graph. Ingest, classify, and index new sources of structured and unstructured data including resumes, policy documents, program artifacts, proposals, process maps, and systems documentation.

      "description_full": "About the job\n\nAI Scout - Commission-Based Partnership\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions | Remote | Flexible | 1099 Contractor\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\n\n\n\nVisit: https://kerzieconsulting.com/ai-scout-opportunity\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"Apply Now\" button and fill out the application form to apply.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions is building a network of AI Scouts - driven individuals who identify Small businesses struggling with customer communication and connect them with Unison, our AI-powered solution that handles phone calls, texts, website chat/voice, and social media channels from a single knowledge base.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a traditional sales job. You are a scout - someone who spots opportunity before others do. You find the HVAC company whose calls go to voicemail after 5pm. The dental office drowning in appointment requests. The property manager who cannot keep up with tenant inquiries. You get the contract signed; we handle the rest.\n\n\n\n\nHow you find businesses is up to you. Tap your existing network, join a business networking group, cold call, knock on doors, run ads, leverage social media, attend local events - whatever works. We care about results, not methods.\n\n\n\n\nSuccess in this role looks like: Building a portfolio of 15+ clients generating $2,900+/month in recurring commission, while helping small businesses deliver consistent customer experiences around the clock. There is no ceiling on this. You can do the math to see what your exit from the 9-5 treadmill looks like if that is your goal. This can also be a lucrative side hustle. This is different for every scout. The opportunity is there if you want it. \n\n\n\n\nHow this fits into Kerzie AI: Scouts are our frontline growth engine. While our team focuses on building and delivering Unison, you are out in the world finding the businesses who need it most. As we scale toward 300 clients, scouts who get in early will build substantial recurring income streams.\n\n\n\n\nCOMMISSION STRUCTURE\n\n\n\n\nHere is where this opportunity is different from anything you will find in corporate America.\n\n\n\n\nMost sales roles pay you once and move on. Maybe you get a small residual for a quarter or two. Then it is back to zero, chasing the next deal just to stay employed.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a monthly recurring commission structure - and it is virtually unheard of at these rates:\n\n\n\n\n1-2 contracts: 20%\n\n3-9 contracts: 35%\n\n10+ contracts: 50%\n\n\n\n\nExample earnings at $500/month per client:\n\n- 5 clients = $725/month recurring\n\n- 10 clients = $1,675/month recurring\n\n- 20 clients = $4,175/month recurring\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: THIS IS A 1099 CONTRACTOR POSITION\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a W-2 employee role. You are an independent contractor. There is no base salary, no hourly wage, and no guaranteed income. Your earnings are 100% commission-based, determined entirely by the contracts you bring in.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, the upside is real: every contract you sign generates monthly recurring income for as long as that customer continues paying for Unison. You are not building someone else's book of business - you are building your own.\n\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\n\n- Get Unison contracts signed\n\n\n\n\n- Identify small and mid-sized businesses that struggle with customer communication (missed calls, slow response times, lost leads, inconsistent messaging across channels)\n\n\n\n\n- Acquire leads through any method you choose - networking groups, cold outreach, social media, local events, referrals, or creative approaches we have not thought of\n\n\n\n\n- Understand businesses current communication challenges\n\n\n\n\n- Qualify leads by assessing fit for Unison\n\n\n\n\n- Introduce qualified prospects to the Kerzie AI team for onboarding\n\n\n\n\n- Maintain relationships with referred clients to identify additional opportunities and gather feedback\n\n\n\n\n- Track your pipeline and referrals using provided tools and systems\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE PROVIDE\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need to be an AI expert. You do not need to know how to build automations. We will train you on everything you need to know - how to talk to business owners about Unison, how to explain automation in simple terms, and how to identify the pain points that make a business a great fit. You show up ready to learn and hustle; we will make sure you are prepared to get contracts signed.\n\n\n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nRequired:\n\n\n\n\n- Strong interpersonal and communication skills - you are comfortable starting conversations with business owners\n\n\n\n\n-Experienced in B2B sales or consulting\n\n\n\n\n- Self-motivated with the ability to work independently without daily supervision\n\n\n\n\n- Coachable - willing to learn how we talk about AI and automation so you can confidently represent Unison\n\n\n\n\n- Resourcefulness in finding and reaching potential clients through whatever channels work for you\n\n\n\n\n- Reliable internet access and smartphone\n\n\n\n\nPreferred:\n\n\n\n\n- Familiarity with local business communities (Existing network, Chamber of Commerce, BNI, industry associations, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n- Understanding of how small businesses operate - their challenges, constraints, and priorities\n\n\n\n\nNot Required:\n\n\n\n\n- Technical background or coding experience\n\n\n\n\n- AI expertise or experience building automations - we teach you everything you need to know\n\n\n\n\n- Full-time availability - You choose how much time you would like to invest in this opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT KERZIE AI SOLUTIONS\n\n\n\n\nKerzie AI Solutions helps small businesses deliver consistent, high-quality customer communication across every channel - 24/7. Our flagship product, Unison, combines telecom expertise with applied AI to handle phone calls, website chat/voice, SMS, and social media channel inquiries from a unified knowledge base.\n\n\n\n\nWe believe every business deserves the customer communication infrastructure of a Fortune 500 company. Unison makes that possible at $500/month with no hidden fees or per-message charges.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about Kerzie AI and Unison: https://kerzie.ai\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\n\n\n\nVisit: https://kerzieconsulting.com/ai-scout-opportunity\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"Apply Now\" button and fill out the application form to apply.",

Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.\n\nZocdoc\u2019s mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we\u2019ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.\n\nWe\u2019re 18 years old and the leader in our space, but we are still just getting started.
