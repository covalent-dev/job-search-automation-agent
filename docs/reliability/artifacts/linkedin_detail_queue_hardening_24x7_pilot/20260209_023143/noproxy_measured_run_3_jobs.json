After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn\u2019t work together.\n\nSo we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions \u2013 to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we\u2019ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.\n\nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes \u2013 large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

      "description_full": "About the job\n\nPlease do NOT apply to this role through LinkedIn! ... US Only\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s face it, nobody cares about a puffed-up job description telling you how \u201ccutting edge\u201d the company is.\n\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s make this about you.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about you being a builder... and currently not building anything that actually works under pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s about you craving deeper technical challenges, but you\u2019re too busy duct-taping brittle prompts to chase that dream.\n\nIt\u2019s about you knowing there's a better way\u2014one rooted in consistency, metrics, and clarity\u2014but your current team thinks \u201ctalking nicely to the model\u201d is enough.\n\nIt\u2019s about you wanting ownership over cognitive systems that behave as predictably as real code.\n\n\n\n\n\u2026And it\u2019s about you tackling the hard problems\u2014like output reliability, schema enforcement, and evaluation pipelines\u2014that actually move AI from magic to product.\n\n\n\n\nYour Problems Solved!\n\nThis is not a \"creative writing\" gig. You\u2019ll engineer deterministic behavior inside non-deterministic systems. Your mission is to architect prompts that yield consistent, structured outputs (primarily JSON), integrate directly into Intertru.ai\u2019s API-driven stack, and hold up under real-world usage\u2014every time.\n\n\n\n\nBy designing golden datasets, regression test suites, and evaluation metrics, your work will define what \"reliable AI\" means. You\u2019ll analyze performance across models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and open-source alternatives to select the best engine for each job. Your systems-thinking mindset will empower our platform to move faster, scale smarter, and deliver accuracy at scale.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first 90 days, you will conquer the following:\n\n30-Day Deliverables:\n\nAudit all current production prompts and identify at least 3 key inconsistency risks across our core flows (accuracy, structure, or latency).\nCreate and document a standardized JSON schema format for all structured outputs and enforce it across at least 2 primary use cases.\nBuild a \"Golden Dataset\" of 100+ validated prompt/input-output examples to serve as a foundation for regression testing.\n\n\n\n\n60-Day Deliverables:\n\nLaunch automated regression testing for at least 3 production prompts, with a defined performance scoring system (accuracy, structure adherence, token cost).\nBenchmark at least 2 LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5) for latency, cost, and output consistency on key use cases; present findings and recommendation.\nCollaborate with engineering to integrate prompt versioning into Git or a prompt ops platform; document and train team on rollback protocol.\n\n\n\n\n90-Day Deliverables:\n\nDesign and deploy a full prompt evaluation suite (Eval) that triggers on prompt updates, validating against golden datasets.\nOptimize at least 2 prompts for lower token usage while maintaining \u226595% accuracy on critical structured outputs.\nPublish a 90-day prompt performance report tracking model behavior, format consistency, and improvement over time.\n\n\n\n\nSoft Skills\n\nYou thrive in ambiguity, love systems thinking, and obsess over repeatability. Your communication is crisp and direct\u2014because clarity builds trust across engineering and product teams. You\u2019re the person who calls out vague requirements and replaces them with testable criteria. You have a scientific mindset, a relentless curiosity, and a deep intolerance for flakiness in AI behavior. You play well with builders but know how to lead when it\u2019s time to ship.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nYou bring hands-on experience with OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source LLMs via API\u2014not just chat interfaces. You\u2019ve deployed prompt chains that use advanced techniques like CoT, Few-Shot, and ToT prompting to solve complex problems. You know how to enforce strict JSON/XML structures in responses, and how to test them for integrity. You\u2019re fluent in Python and capable of building eval harnesses using tools like LangChain, DSPy, or custom logic. You can benchmark models, dial in temperature, and debug prompt behaviors under load.\n\n\n\n\nMust Haves\n\nYou\u2019ve done real-world prompt engineering\u2014not just demos. You think in systems, not scripts. You\u2019ve created evaluation frameworks to score prompt performance, enforced structure in LLM outputs, and understand how to trade off between model cost, latency, and accuracy. If you can\u2019t explain how you use regression testing for prompts or how to enforce a JSON schema 100% of the time, this isn\u2019t the role for you. We\u2019re not looking for content writers\u2014we\u2019re hiring engineers who treat prompts as critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nIntertru.ai is a method-driven interviewing accuracy platform that uses AI and the HireOS\u00ae methodology to ensure that your company hires the strongest people, every time. We released our MVP in November and have already secured paying customers. We are bootstrapped, pre-funded, and solving massive challenges\u2014especially around customer success delivery and execution excellence. \n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re managing, but we\u2019re also pushing limits every day.\n\nWhat really makes us a place where you\u2019ll thrive? Our Core Values. We live by them. We hire by them. We build by them. https://www.intertru.ai\n\n\n\n\nOur core values guide our commitment to excellence:\n\nYou First\n\nWe prioritize and empower your growth. We care deeply about you and your business. Our actions demonstrate genuine empathy, understanding, and solutions that deliver measurable value to you. Also, we say please, thank you, and hold the door open for others.\n\nDig Deeper\n\nWe listen to understand, not to respond and it is in our nature to ask the difficult questions that enable us to attack the root of the issue. We consistently hone our expertise using targeted data. Making sure our solutions are proven in the real world with concrete results.\n\nCommit Action\n\nWe set measurable goals, hold each other accountable, and take corrective action. Our approach is to initiate communication that uncovers issues before they become real problems. We operate from win-win and walk from win-lose situations.\n\nRe-Evolutionary\n\nWe are people who defy the shackles of conventional constraints. We reject \u201cbest practices\u201d \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d, or the \u201cstatus quo\u201d perspectives that produce mediocre results. With a relentless spirit of rebellion, we celebrate failure and challenge one another to break boundaries and rewrite the rules of what real success means.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s your Call To Action!\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you have grit\u2014and we should meet. While a resume is important, we want to get to know you as a person.\n\n\n\n\nPlease email your resume to rick@intertru.ai and answer these three questions:\n\nWhat motivated you to respond to this role?\nWhat do you feel you are capable of achieving?\nHow can we best reach you for a conversation this week?\n\n\n\n\nWe only respond to people who invest the time in providing well-thought-out (non-AI) responses!",
