# ISP Proxy Pool Glassdoor Reliability (per proxy)

This report is generated by `scripts/proxy_pool_reliability.py`.

## How To Generate

Prereqs:
- Set `ISP_PROXY_ENDPOINTS` locally in `.env` (gitignored). Do not commit this value.
- Ensure any other Glassdoor tasks are not running (the script enforces a coordination gate by default).

Static check:

```bash
cd /root/covalent-dev/job-search-automation-agent
python3 -m compileall -q shared boards scripts
```

Phase A (filter across all proxies):

```bash
python3 scripts/proxy_pool_reliability.py --filter-runs 5 --sleep-seconds 45
```

Phase B (measured for a subset, pick top candidates from Phase A):

```bash
python3 scripts/proxy_pool_reliability.py --only-indexes 2,4 --measured-runs 10 --sleep-seconds 45
```

## Latest Results

_Not yet generated in this workspace session (live execution is gated by other in-progress Glassdoor tasks)._
