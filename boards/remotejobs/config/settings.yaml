  scoring_prompt: 'You are filtering + scoring jobs for fit with the target search
    intent.

    First decide include/exclude. If exclude, score must be 0.

    Return ONLY valid JSON with this schema:

    {{"include": <true|false>, "score": <0-10 integer>, "reason": "<short phrase>"}}

    Keep reason under 12 words. No extra text. No markdown/code fences.

    Example: {{"include": true, "score": 7, "reason": "Strong ML fit"}}

    Exclude if the role is clearly off-target (wrong domain, senior-only, unrelated
    function).
